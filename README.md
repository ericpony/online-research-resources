# Game theory / concurrent games

### Two-player zero sum games played on graphs

MOVEP 2020

The class of two-player zero sum games played on graphs is a canonical model to formalize and reason about the non-terminating interaction between a system and its environment. In this series of lectures, I will expose fundamental results for game graphs both for omega-regular objectives and for quantitative objectives. Those results will cover algorithms and complexity analysis of the central problems in the area.

# First-order logic

### Ultimately periodic sets, semi-linear sets, and Presburger arithmetic

How to generalize ultimately periodic sets of natural numbers to several dimensions? An answer to this question is the definition of semi-linear sets. These sets coincide with the sets definable in Presburger arithmetic, the first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition and order, and have numerous applications in the foundations of verification. In this short tutorial, I will give an introduction to semi-linear sets and Presburger arithmetic, illustrating several classic techniques as well as recent developments. In particular, we will look at the geometry of sets of solutions to linear Diophantine inequalities and review the complexity of related computational problems.
