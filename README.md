# Game theory / concurrent games

### Synthesizing safe coalition strategies

Nathalie Bertrand, Patricia Bouyer, Anirban Majumdar, 2020

Concurrent games with a fixed number of agents have been thoroughly studied, with various solution concepts and objectives for the agents. In this paper, we consider concurrent games with an arbitrary number of agents, and study the problem of synthesizing a coalition strategy to achieve a global safety objective. The problem is non-trivial since the agents do not know a priori how many they are when they start the game. We prove that the existence of a safe arbitrary-large coalition strategy for safety objectives is a PSPACE-hard problem that can be decided in exponential space.

### Two-player zero sum games played on graphs

Jean-Francois Raskin, MOVEP 2020

The class of two-player zero sum games played on graphs is a canonical model to formalize and reason about the non-terminating interaction between a system and its environment. In this series of lectures, I will expose fundamental results for game graphs both for omega-regular objectives and for quantitative objectives. Those results will cover algorithms and complexity analysis of the central problems in the area.

### A note on game theory and verification

Patricia Bouyer, ATVA 2019

We present some basics of game theory, focusing on matrix games. We then present the model of multiplayer *stochastic* concurrent games (with an underlying graph), which extends standard finite-state models used in verification in a multiplayer and concurrent setting; we explain why the basic theory cannot apply to that general model. We then focus on a very simple setting, and explain and give intuitions for the computation of *Nash equilibria*. We then give a number of undecidability results, giving limits to the approach. Finally we describe the suspect game construction, which (we believe) captures and explains well Nash equilibria and allow to compute them in many cases.
